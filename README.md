### 2018/07–2019/04 page performance evaluating tool
Use lighthouse to evaluate the performance indicators of important pages online in Koala, and at the same time build a front-end performance platform to collect performance data from online pages and generate performance reports. This work is based on the increasingly large number of Koala developers. Pages will be published online every week, but the performance evaluation of the pages is not included in the development process, so the developed page output needs to be evaluated to ensure the performance of the online pages.

### 2015/06–2017/05 E-commerce activity page build platform
It mainly allows operators to freely build activity pages and develop the module development work of the page. Subsequent operations can use the modules to build corresponding activity page modules. Koala's activity page has more than 100 modules to build operation and marketing pages. In such a large amount of module data On the front-end page, a lot of performance optimization work needs to be done to improve the user experience.

### 2017/11–2018/1 Weex framework
The H5 activity page was frozen when scrolling in the app browser (uiwebview), which greatly affected the user experience. At that time, it was very difficult to upgrade the uiwebview in the app, so weex solution was used to solve this user experience. Design a complete set of weex solutions and combine it with Kaola's own business needs to put forward higher performance requirements for weex pages. Weex is widely used in the Kaola app and indeed brings a good experience to users. Basically reaching the app experience, but the price is that development needs to spend more time to complete the development of the weex module, and then we can have the idea of ​​optimizing the ultimate performance of H5.

## technical result

- deploy web app on nodejs, split a large project into several projects
- H5 page performance optimize
